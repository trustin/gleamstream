## Gleamstream

Gleamstream is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for
Linux, MacOS X and Microsoft Windows.

It has been forked from [Moonlight](http://moonlight-stream.com/) because Moonlight is moving away from Java-based
[moonlight-pc](https://github.com/moonlight-streaming/moonlight-pc) to Chrome-based
[moonlight-chrome](https://github.com/moonlight-streaming/moonlight-chrome). I'm still interested in making the
Java-based version better-performing and well-maintained, especially because I use it for my Linux machine everyday.

Like Moonlight, Gleamstream is licensed under
[GPL (GNU General Public License) 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

started as a project at [MHacks](http://mhacks.org).
