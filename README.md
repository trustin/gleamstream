#Limelight

Limelight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Linux/OSX/Windows.

Limelight-pc allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to another PC or laptop running Linux/OSX/Windows.

implementation.
